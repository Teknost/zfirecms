 		<p>What is the primary purpose of your website?  Which of the following best describes your intention?
      <ul>
        <li>Deliver information to users (possibly to lead to a sale or other monetizing behavior).</li>
        <li>Directly monetize users’ behavior.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Much of today’s web technology caters to direct monetization, while much of the original web technology from the ‘90s focused on information delivery.  <em>But these two dramatically different purposes of a web site remain today.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
		Web technology that excels at monetizing user behavior <em>can</em> also deliver information, but it does so with massive costs and overheads that are sometimes hard to spot.  As web technology optimized for information delivery does not perform in the arena of monetizing user behavior, such technology has too few modern treatments.
    </p>
    <p>
    Zfire CMS addresses this need with modern, secure, and maintainable solutions.
