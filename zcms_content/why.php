		<p><strong>Fact:</strong> Small, medium, and large businesses all need a web presence.</p>
		<p><strong>Fact:</strong> In many of these cases, they do not need a persistent, customized experience per user for their entire website.  Some businesses do not need it at all.  This is the classic “brochureware” website case.</p>
		<p><strong>Fact:</strong> Maintaining a classic "brochureware" site without a framework (straight HTML for example) is either cumbersome when done right, or results in sloppy inconsistencies.  Further, websites lacking in dynamic, constantly fresh content are deprecated in search results and they exercise less hold on an audience.</p>
		<p><strong>Fact:</strong> Large web application frameworks and Content Management Systems supply a great deal more customizability and capability than the classic brochureware website case needs.</p>
		<p><strong>Fact:</strong> Web Application Frameworks, Content Management Systems, and all of their plugins require constant administrative work in terms of version upgrades, compatibility issue mitigation with said upgrades, and vulnerability patching, etc…  And vulnerabilities are often exploited prior to patch availability, so websites get hacked, vandalized, and turned into spam or virus propagation engines.</p>
		<p><strong>Fact:</strong> A user’s experience with a website can be slowed down by three main factors: many HTTP requests for the page’s resources, complex JavaScript rendering, and server response slowness due to complex server-side code.</p>
		<hr />
		<p>Zfire CMS was developed to provide a basic website framework that is nearly immune to common website hacking attacks and lightning fast at page delivery, by providing alternative approaches to all of the problems described above.  Zfire CMS is not the right tool for every job, but it is the absolute right tool for certain jobs: <strong>brochureware websites</strong> in particular.  Other use cases that Zfire CMS fits in ideal ways are <strong>dashboards</strong> and <strong>portal sites</strong>.</p>
